1) Split horizon prevents a router from advertising a route back onto an interface that it was learned.
  This might be disabled if the interface has more than one device on it, for example a frame-relay interface with multiple DLC's

2)
 Hello          Multicast           Unreliable
 ACK            Unicast             Reliable
 Update         Unicast(new)        Reliable
                Multicast(changes)
 Query/Reply    Unicast(Reply)      Reliable
                Multicast(Query)
 
3) The feasibility condition determins whether a route is feasible for the current router. To be feasible, it's advertised distance must be less than the feasable distance of the current route.

4) Administrative distance is used to decided which type of route should be preferred.
 Local: 0
 Static: 1
 eBGP: 20
 EIGRP: 90
 IGRP: 100
 OSPF: 110
 ISIS: 115
 RIP: 120
 eEIGRP: 200

5) A floating static route is a route that will only be used as a backup when a dynamic route vanishes. Generally, it's AD will be higher than all other routes.

6) A passive interface doesn't send updates, but will be it's subnets will be advertised by other algorithmns

7) EIGRP neighbors statements for each neighbor 

8) Address size

9) OSPF is not vender specific, EIGRP is. EIGRP is easier to configure (initially). EIGRP uses the DUAL algorithmn, OSPF doesn't

10) 10^8/Bandwidth + delay. One can also use reliability and load.

11) It will use no more than 50% for routing updates

12) When packets are dropped due to congestion
